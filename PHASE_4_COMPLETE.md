- **canManageProject** - User must be owner or manager
- **canEditProject** - User cannot be viewer
- **requireRole(...roles)** - Factory for custom role checks

### Security Features:

## Database Operations

### Tables Used:
- `projects` - Project data
- `project_members` - User-project relationships
- `activity_logs` - Audit trail
- `users` - User lookups

### Transaction Safety:
All write operations use transactions:
- Create project + add owner member
- Update project + log activity
- Delete project + log activity
- Add/update/remove member + log activity

---

## Validation Rules

### Create Project:
- `name` - Required, max 255 characters
- `description` - Optional

## Permission Matrix

| Action | Viewer | Member | Manager | Owner |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| View project | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View members | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Error Handling

### Common Errors:
- `400` - Validation errors, invalid data
- `401` - Not authenticated
- `403` - Insufficient permissions
- `404` - Project not found or no access
- `409` - User already a member

### Examples:
```json
// Validation error
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Validation error: Project name is required"
}

// Permission error
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Only project owners can delete projects"
}

// Not found
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Project not found or access denied"
}
```

## Activity Logging

All operations are logged to `activity_logs` table:

```json
{
  "project_id": 1,
  "user_id": 1,
  "entity_type": "project",
  "entity_id": 1,
  "action": "created",
  "changes": {
    "name": "Website Redesign",
    "description": "Complete redesign"
  }
}
```

Actions logged:
- `created` - Project created
- `updated` - Project updated
- `deleted` - Project deleted
- Member `created` - Member added
- Member `updated` - Role changed
- Member `deleted` - Member removed

## What's Working

### Complete Workflows:
1. **Create a project** → User becomes owner
2. **List projects** → See all projects you're a member of
3. **Add team members** → Invite by email with role
4. **Manage permissions** → Owner can change roles
5. **Update project** → Manager/Owner can edit
6. **Delete project** → Owner can soft-delete
7. **Activity tracking** → All changes logged

### Integration:
- ✅ Works with existing auth system
- ✅ JWT authentication required
- ✅ User context from auth middleware
- ✅ Activity logs track user actions

## Next Steps - Phase 5: Tasks API

Will implement:
- Task CRUD operations
- Task dependencies (for Gantt chart)
- Task assignments
- Subtasks (hierarchical)
- Task status and progress tracking
- Due dates and scheduling

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
